# 📈 AI Intraday News Engine (India)

An AI-powered, fully automated news intelligence system designed to detect **high-impact, company-specific news** in the Indian stock market that can move stocks **intraday**.

Unlike simple keyword or price-based scanners, this system uses **AI reasoning** to evaluate:
- Severity of the news
- Permanence of impact
- Continuation probability (can the move extend further?)
- Whether the reaction is under- or over-priced

Alerts are sent **only when there is a real trading edge**.
